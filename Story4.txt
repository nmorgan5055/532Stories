A down-on-his-luck gambler stumbles upon a mysterious game of chance hidden in a corner of Disney World, where winning could change his life forever.

He has stumbled on a secret room filled with games in every corner.

"Hello!", a high-pitched voice yells out.

He looks to see where the voice came from, and is shocked to see a dapper robot in a red suit and black top-hat.

"What is this?"

"A robot, what do you think?"

The confusion did nothing but increase as a series of slot appeared on the chest of the robot.

"Everyone knows just one more try is all a gambler needs!"

The gambler reached for the lever.

"I'm feeling lucky" he said as he pulled the lever with all his might

The slots began spinning as the gambler stared at the machine with hunger in his eyes.

As the machine slotted to one cherry, then two, his hear began racing as he imagined his big win.

The last slot landed on a banana and the gambler's heart dropped.

"Oh, that's quite unfortunate." The robot said. "But you know, 93% of gamblers quit before their big win." The robot finished gesturing toward the lever.

The gambler weighed his options, he must pull the lever again.
