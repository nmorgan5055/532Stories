A down-on-his-luck gambler stumbles upon a mysterious game of chance hidden in a corner of Disney World, where winning could change his life forever.

He has stumbled on a secret room filled with games in every corner.

"Hello!", a high-pitched voice yells out.

He looks to see where the voice came from, and is shocked to see a dapper robot in a red suit and black top-hat.

"What is this?"

"A robot, what do you think?"

The confusion did nothing but increase as a series of slot appeared on the chest of the robot.

"Everyone knows just one more try is all a gambler needs!"

The gambler reached for the lever.  The slots began spinning rapidly.
