Amidst the cheerful chaos of Disney World, a disenchanted park employee contemplates the meaning of happiness while cleaning up after ecstatic visitors.

Gerald hates Disney World. All he does for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week is sweep up dirt and pick up cups that missed trashcans. The job does not pay well, he's taken out three mortgages and filed for bankruptcy twice. The only thing left that Gerald has is this job at the kingdom of that big eared freak. 
Nothing about the happiest place on earth is happy for Gerald.

Too many kids, too many families, too much loud loud "fun."

Life would be much better for Gerald in silence, cleanliness, and peace.
