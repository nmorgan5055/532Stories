As the sun sets over a desolate highway motel in the middle of a steamy hot June, a juice-soaked writer 
confronts his inner demons in a fevered battle of words, culminating in a midnight showdown that could

He grabbed his pen and accepted his fate. Fire erupted from his woode fountain pen as the ink inside began pouring absolut bars onto the paper.
The gecko began to sweat as he fumbled his holster and pulled out a wooden pencil inside.
