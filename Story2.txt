A gritty, no-nonsense postal worker discovers a forgotten manuscript in the dead-letter office, 
penned by an anonymous author whose words reveal the hidden desires and regrets of the city's forgotten souls.


It had been a long day of delivering mail, and Jeff was hoping to go home and sleep.  
As he was leaving, a mysterious letter fell off of the shelf, sending a cloud of dust into the air.  
Curious, Jeff walked over and picked up the letter.

It was written in a typewriter and addressed to John F Kennedy.

Mr. Kennedy,

If you are reading this... The moon has rats...
Bring the big guns

Thank you,
(Some mystery general)

The postal worker, knowing he broke the law reading the message hurridly put it back on the shelf.
"I didn't see anything. I don't know anything."

He forgot everything he read about the moon's infestation and went home to go to sleep, happy his day was finally over.
